                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">India’s Chandrayaan-3 mission achieved a historic milestone by becoming the first spacecraft to successfully land on the Moon’s south polar region. The Vikram lander touched down flawlessly, and the Pragyan rover began exploring the lunar surface, collecting valuable data on water ice presence.

                    <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm mt-1">By Sofia Grant | April 2023</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">In a bizarre turn of events at the prestigious Sony World Photography Awards, a German artist, Boris Eldagsen, submitted an AI-generated image titled Pseudomnesia: The Electrician — and it won first prize in the creative category. The image, a haunting black-and-white portrait, fooled expert judges who had no idea it wasn’t shot with a camera. Eldagsen later refused the prize, revealing he used AI to highlight how unprepared the art world is for artificial intelligence. The incident sparked a heated global debate about authenticity, copyright, and the future of photography.</p>

Clocking in at 3 hours 48 minutes, Goldstein said he wanted to prove comfort is subjective. Spectators cheered as he crossed the finish line, and photos of his outfit quickly went viral.
